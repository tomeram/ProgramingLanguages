"""
This module contains functions for analyzing a grammar, finding
its NULLABLE, FIRST, FOLLOW and SELECT sets, and determining if it is
LL(1).

A grammar is represented as a list of rules of the form (head, body)
where head is the goal non-terminal, and body is a tuple of symbols,
or the empty tuple () for an epsilon rule.

The start symbol is always the head of the first rule in the list.
